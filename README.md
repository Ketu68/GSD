# GSD
Galaxian Space Defender

To check out the game - always a work in progress - download as a ZIP and extract it to any old folder on your desktop.  
Then run the GSD.exe file in the 2018Build folder.  Windows Defender should pop up a warning about trying to run an unknown
program.  If it does just choose 'details' and then 'Run anyway'.
